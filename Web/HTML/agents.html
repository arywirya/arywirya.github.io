                                Firewatch comes from unknown origins. She fought for many years on the border between Kazimierz and Ursus. It is suspected that she was a guerrilla during this time. She shows deep experience in asymmetric operations like ambushes, sniping, unconventional tactics, and mobile tactics.

                                Sarkaz mercenary Mudrock, formerly a part of the Reunion Movement, led her team far from Ursus after disagreements with the organization. She had no involvement with Reunion whatsoever during the incidents in Chernobog and Lungmen. Searching for a foothold to establish, Mudrock took her team towards Leithania. After taking in a great number of Leithanien Infected there, Mudrock became a highly esteemed leader, and her team came to be known as the "Mudrock Squad." Despite Mudrock's multiple attempts to avoid conflict with other powers, her side was nevertheless drawn into constant disputes. So as to prevent any further meaningless sacrifice, Mudrock chose to head for Kazdel. She came into contact with elite operator Logos within Kazdel's borders, and left with the latter for Rhodes Island.

                                During testing, Surtr displayed an inexplicably high combat prowess, and was quickly drafted as a combat operator.

                                Nian, unemployed, is familiar with all kinds of metal craftsmanship and exhibits a profound knowledge in metallurgy that is inconsistent with her background. She is currently staying in Rhodes Island as a visitor, occasionally advising on Rhodes Island's metalworking projects. She claims to be skilled in audio-visual entertainment, often providing products that are not received too well by Operators.
